# Welcome to Zammad

Zammad is a web based open source helpdesk/ticket system with many features
to manage customer communication via several channels like telephone, facebook,
twitter, chat and emails. It is distributed under the GNU AFFERO General Public
 License (AGPL). Do you receive many emails and want to answer them with a team of agents?
You're going to love Zammad!

## Use cases

This repository is the starting point if you want to:

- deploy Zammad in a containerized production environment
- test the current `stable` or `develop` versions of Zammad

## Getting started

## Using a reverse proxy

In environments with more then one web applications it is necessary to use a reverse proxy to route connections to port 80 and 443 to the right application.
To run Zammad behind a reverse proxy, we provide `docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` as a starting point.

1. Copy `./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml` to your own configuration, e.g. `./docker-compose.prod.yml`
    `cp ./.examples/proxy/docker-compose.proxy-example.yml ./docker-compose.prod.yml`
2. Modify the environment variable `VIRTUAL_HOST` and the name of the external network in `./docker-compose.prod.yml` to fit your environment.
3. Run docker-composer commands with the default and your configuration, e.g. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`

See `.examples/proxy/docker-compose.yml` for an example proxy project.

Like this, you can add your `docker-compose.prod.yml` to a branch of your Git repository and stay up to date by merging changes to your branch.

## Using Rancher

```console
RANCHER_URL=http://RANCHER_HOST:8080 rancher-compose --env-file=.env up
```

## Running without Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an optional, but strongly recommended dependency for Zammad. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/prerequisites/software.html#elasticsearch-optional). There are however certain scenarios when running without Elasticsearch may be desired, e.g. for very small teams, for teams with limited budget or as a temporary solution for an unplanned Elasticsearch downtime or planned cluster upgrade.

Elasticsearch is enabled by default in the example `docker-compose.yml` file. It is also by default required to run the "zammad-init" command. Disabling Elasticsearch is possible by setting a special environment variable: `ELASTICSEARCH_ENABLED=false` for the `zammad-init` container and removing all references to Elasticsearch everywhere else: the `zammad-elasticsearch` container, its volume and links to it.
